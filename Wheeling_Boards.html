        <h3>Game Art and Animation</h3>
        <p>
            1. Demonstrate and communicate aesthetic skills and choices based on traditional art theory, current game development
            practices and next-generation research.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Conceptualize and generate pre-production art assets through pre-visualization and prototypes usable for multiple game
            platforms.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Demonstrate a cross-section of baseline skills needed to create 2D and 3D art, textures and animation assets utilizing

            4. Demonstrate the ability to build industry-quality game assets specializing in specific 2D and/or 3D art and/or animations
            utilizing industry-standard software tools, pipelines and platform guidelines.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. Adapt, export, integrate, and optimize game art and animation assets (including shaders and lighting) into 2D and 3D
            game projects working within a production pipeline and the confines of a projectâ€™s game engine, tools and other
            constraints.
            <br>
