    <h1>Australian Shepherds!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm Brie and the picture below is my Australian Shepherd Koda!
        <br>
        As can be seen he has heterochromia as common in Aussies. Funfact we picked him out cause he had different color eyes.
        <br>
        We were also told that he was a Mini Australian Shepherd but this year he's turning 5 years old and he's about 50lbs.
        <br>
        Most people think he's over weight when they first see him but thats not the case at all, he just has very thick fur and is very muscular underneath.
